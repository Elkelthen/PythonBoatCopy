Updated: All of the above is good, but this is the direction we're going.

    Man don't I wish. It would appear, however, that we can't use this because it only works with the right boards?
    Thanks, adafruit. back to pybleno I guess.

Since we don't have access to Central-type methods from the pybleno library, we need another library to handle that stuff
    https://ianharvey.github.io/bluepy-doc/ <- bluepy is pretty official anyway and fills in the gaps from pybleno...

IMPORTANT: I was trying for quite some time to get bluepy working. I figured out why it wasn't... I had named my file bluepy.py
           You can't do that, as is now obvious to me, or importing that name will attempt to import the file with which you are
           working. Which doesn't have the object you want to use... Sometimes my idiocy is overwhelming lol.

Comms:
    ID: 1 byte
    LAT/LONG: 8 Each = 16

    Padding = 4
    Timestamp = Calculated by the local Pi.

Install ble-serial ("pip3 install ble-serial") So that hopefully we can use a virtual ble port.
Currently, scanning and advertising are trying to happen on the same port, which blocks, which sucks.

Install smbus2
